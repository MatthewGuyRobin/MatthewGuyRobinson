        <h2>Smithills School</h2>
        <p>
            Smithills school was one of the first life changing decisions that I made. I enjoyed secondary school, the more so the older I get, the school was benefical for me I did rather well at my GCSE's I left the school with over 10 GCSE's C and above. During my last year of school I opted for an Army Work experience which involved a 5 day residential this included the early get ups at 0600, your beds never being tucked in enough resulting having them thrown all over dorm again and again.
