        <p class=" center paramov">
            Smithills school was one of the first life changing decisions that I made. I enjoyed secondary school, the
            more so the older I get, the school was benefical for me I did rather well at my GCSE's I left the school
            with over 14 GCSE's C and above. During my last year of school I opted for an Army Work experience which
            involved a 5 day residential this included the early get ups at 0600, your beds never being tucked in enough
            resulting having them thrown all over the dorm again and again.

        <p class ="center paramov">
            During my time at Bolton Sixth Form I studied Religion & Philosophy(B), Business(C) & Psychology(C). This is when I first began to further develop my organisation skills as the volume of information that had to be retained for exams had vastly jumped since G.C.S.E level.
