            We have learnt the types of data which we will be using; string - this represents text, number, boolean meaning is it true or false, Null meaning nothing & undefined meaning the data type is not defined.
            This data has associated methods within Javascript libraries.
        </p>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <h3>variables - let, const & var</h3>
        <p>
            We use variables to store information inside them, we can call them when we need to and be and be able to store new data in them.
        </p>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <h3> if else & switch</h3>
        <p>
            In this session we created programs with single and multiple conditions while using comparison operators such as == so for example we had one condition of the place and the second condition age, so if you were from the UK and below the age of 17 the console would log that "You are not old enough" however if you were from the UK and was age was equal and or greater than 18 you would be served.

        <p>
            I want to complete the Javascript challenges on loops to become more confident and gain a better understanding of them.
