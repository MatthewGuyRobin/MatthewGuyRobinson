            I am currently on an apprenticeship at Code Nation studying to be a software developer. I have taken the decision to further myself by developing skills within the tech industry as this is what I am passionate about. Since being a child I was always interested in how and why technology worked while most boys my age were playing offline on their Playstation 2, I was playing on a computer online with real people around the world, this is what first opened my eyes to the possibilities of technology.

           My most recent role I was responsible for extraction of medical records so that these records could then be included within our clients medical reports. The role required someone techincal for the job as it meant working with various portals and discs from various vendors using various different applications. On starting this new role the department was two weeks behind on service level agreement over the next 6 weeks I worked 11 hour shifts in order to get us back within SLA. One task I was responsible for was the encryption of none password protected discs, about a third of records received on disc were not password protected meaning I had to take longer to deal with, I began a log of those hospitals that have protected their discs and those that had not, once I had collected these details I approached Hospitals who have not password protected and asked if they could update their process to be GDPR compliant. This meant that the volume that was coming through our department required less time to encrypt.

            The journey that has led me to Code Nation began January 2019 when I came across an advertisement, prior to this I had been searching for a course that would develop my skills & give me an opportunity at a brighter career. I have always been taught that education is key and to follow something that you're interested in.
